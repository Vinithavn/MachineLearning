A chest x-ray produces images of the heart, lungs, airways, blood vessels, and the bones of the spine and chest. 
Often time, it is the duty of a radiologist to conclude these x-rays so that to give appropriate treatment to the patients. 
It is often time-consuming and tedious to get detailed medical reports from these x-rays. 
In high population countries, a radiologist may come across 100s of x-ray images. So if a properly learned machine learning model can automatically generate these medical reports, considerable work and time can be saved. 
In this case study, we are using the data given by the Indiana University hospital network. Here a set of chest x-rays and corresponding medical reports are provided. 
Given an x-ray image, we need to generate the medical report of that x-ray.
