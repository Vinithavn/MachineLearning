Task 1: To explore the supervised machine learning

Description: In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. 
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

Prediction:
What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a
day?

Task 2: To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning

Description:From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
